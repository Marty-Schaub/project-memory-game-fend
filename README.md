## Instructions

To play the game, open Index.html in a browser. The game starts when you click on the first card. The game ends when you click the refresh button next to the timer or when you have matched all the cards.



## Notes
This project is a mixture of the starter code, 1 piece of code that I used from the research on the Internet and my own coding. I did credit the source on the pieces I used from the Internet. Any other similarities are coincidental.
