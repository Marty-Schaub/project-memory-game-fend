## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I modified the index, Javascript and CSS files to get the desired funcitonality.


## Contributing

This repository is my version of the game after modifying the Udacity starter code. Until it has passed on my ownn, I can not accept any changes to it. 

## Notes
This project is a mixture of the starter code, 1 piece of code that I used from the research on the internet and my own coding. I did credit the source on the piece I used from the internet. Any other similiaraties are coincidental.
